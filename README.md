# commandprotection
> A super long list of commands that can be dangrous. This includes commands from `Minecraft`, `Windows Powershell`, `Terminal` (MacOS, Windows, and Linix) and much more in the future probably.

> [!CAUTION]
> There is many good commands that one might need such as in `Minecraft` you might need to de-op a rouge operator or op a friendly one but this list blocks both and much more useful ones! **In short, check if the commands your script needs is not on the list or you might up ending up with the inabilty to do ANYTHING.**.
